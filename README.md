# Coffee Project

Welcome to the Coffee Project! This web-based application, centered around coffee, has been designed with an emphasis on a dynamic and engaging user interface.

One of the key features of this project is the robust search functionality that allows users to effortlessly navigate through an extensive list of coffees. Users can search by coffee name, and the results update in real-time as they type into the search bar. Additionally, there's a handy option to select roast types, further refining the search results. This responsiveness enhances the user experience by making it easy and intuitive to find the perfect brew from the variety on offer.

Aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly, the Coffee Project represents a seamless blend of design, functionality, and user experience.
